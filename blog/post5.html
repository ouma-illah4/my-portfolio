      <blockquote class="key-verse">
        ‚ÄúUnless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain.‚Äù  
        <br><span>‚Äî Psalm 127:1</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        As I learn to code, I often find myself reflecting on how the process mirrors my walk of faith. 
        Coding requires patience, persistence, and trust in the process. Likewise, faith requires trusting 
        God‚Äôs timing even when we don‚Äôt see immediate results.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Debugging & Repentance</h2>
      <p>
        In coding, errors are part of the journey. Debugging teaches me to look closely at where things went wrong 
        and correct them. In the same way, repentance is God‚Äôs way of helping us ‚Äúdebug‚Äù our lives, 
        removing what‚Äôs broken so His purpose runs smoothly in us.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Step by Step Progress</h2>
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt become a programmer overnight ‚Äî I grow line by line, project by project. Faith works the same way. 
        Jesus said faith the size of a mustard seed can move mountains (Matthew 17:20). Small steps of faith 
        compound into great breakthroughs.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Open Source & Fellowship</h2>
      <p>
        The coding community thrives on open-source collaboration. In the body of Christ, fellowship works the same way. 
        We share wisdom, encourage each other, and build together. Just as no coder grows in isolation, 
        no Christian thrives without fellowship.
      </p>

      <p class="closing">
        üí° <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Whether in faith or coding, growth is a process.  
        Stay patient, trust the Master Builder, and keep taking small steps ‚Äî both in your projects and in your walk with God.
