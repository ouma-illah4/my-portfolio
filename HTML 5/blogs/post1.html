    <h2>The Hidden Treasure</h2>
    <p class="date">August 25, 2025</p>

      In Matthew 13:44, Jesus says, “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure
      hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in
      his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.”
    </p>

      This scripture teaches us that the Kingdom of God is of ultimate worth.
      Just like a hidden treasure, it requires us to give up everything to gain
      something far greater — eternal life and fellowship with God.
    </p>

      As we study the Word, may we remember that pursuing Christ is worth more
      than anything else this world can offer.
